# Ironhack Final Project: Why do people leave their job?


**Author:** Jonatan Aguilera

**Course:** Data Analytics-Part Time | DA-PT-Oct-23 


## Introduction

In my current job as a headhunter, one of the most frequent conversations with clients is about the possibility of a new addition to their team leaving them soon. To address this, we rely on hundreds of conversations with candidates, as well as articles on the subject, in order to advise companies.

This project is a great opportunity to base our analysis on real data with abundant variables to analyze, as well as to create a predictive model that helps us understand the trend of employees leaving the company and their most significant reasons for doing so.

These are the main challenges I faced:
- Lack of sufficient samples for analysis and robust predictive modeling.
- Difficulty finding datasets with adequate variables for the intended measurements.
- Samples often insufficient and influenced by their origin or environment.
- Utilized a sample from IBM in the United States, making the analysis specific to that country.
